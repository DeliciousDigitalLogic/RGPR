\title{Trace average (DEPRECATED, use 'traceStat' instead)}
\usage{
\S4method{traceAverage}{GPR}(x, w = NULL, FUN = mean, ..., track = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of the class GPR}

\item{w}{A length-one integer vector equal to the window length of the 
average window. If \code{w = NULL} a single trace corresponding to
the average trace of the whole profile is returned.}

\item{FUN}{A function to compute the average (default is \code{mean})}

\item{...}{Additional parameters for the FUN functions}
}
\value{
An object of the class GPR. When \code{w = NULL}, this function 
        returns a GPR object with a single trace corresponding to the 
        average trace of the whole radargram. When \code{w} is equal to a
        strictly positive interger this function returns a GPR object with
        a size identical to x where each trace corresponds to the average
        of the \code{w} neighbouring traces centered on the considered trace.
}
\description{
Average traces in a radargram along the distance (horizontal) axis using
a moving window. This can be used to increase signal to noise ratio. Note that if 
the moving window length is not defined, all traces are averaged into one single trace.

\examples{
data("frenkeLine00")

f0 <- frenkeLine00

f1 <- traceAverage(f0)
plot(f1)
# substract the average trace
plot(f0 - f1)

f2 <- traceAverage(f0, w = 20)
plot(f2)
plot(f0 - f2)

f3 <- traceAverage(f0, w = 20, FUN = median)
plot(f3)
plot(f0 - f3)
}
