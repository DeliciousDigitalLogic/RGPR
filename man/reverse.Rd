\title{Reverse the trace position.}
\usage{
\S4method{reverse}{GPR}(x, id = NULL, tol = 0.3)

\S4method{reverse}{GPRsurvey}(x, id = NULL, tol = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of the class \code{GPR} or \code{GPRsurvey}}

\item{id}{Only if \code{x} is an object of the class \code{GPRsurvey}. If 
\code{id = NULL} and \code{x} has coordinates, \code{reverse()} 
will cluster the GPR data according to their names (e.g., 
cluster 1 = XLINE01, XLINE02, XLINE03; cluster 2 = YLINE01, 
YLINE02; cluster 3 = XYLINE1, XYLINE2, XYLINE3) and reverse the
data such that all GPR lines within the same cluster have the
same orientation (up to a tolerance value \code{tol}).}

\item{to}{Length-one numeric vector. Tolerance angle in radian to determine
if the data have the same orientation. The first data of the 
cluster is set as reference angle \eqn{\alpha_0}, then for data 
\eqn{i} in the same cluster, if \eqn{\alpha_i} is not between
\eqn{\alpha_0 - \frac{tol}{2}} and 
\eqn{\alpha_0 + \frac{tol}{2}}, then the data is reversed.}

Reverse the trace position.

Reverse the trace position.

\dontrun{
# SU class GPRsurvey
SU <- reverse(SU, id = "zigzag")
# identical to above
SU <- reverse(SU, id = seq(from = 2, to = length(SU), by = 2))
