\title{Interpolate trace positions from measurement (e.g., GPS).}
\usage{
\S4method{interpPos}{GPR}(
  x,
  topo,
  plot = FALSE,
  r = NULL,
  tol = NULL,
  method = c("linear", "linear", "linear"),
  crs = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of the class GPR.}

\item{topo}{A \eqn{m \times 4} numeric matrix, with \code{m} the number of 
recorded trace positions.
The first 3 columns are the 
coordinates (x, y, z) and the last column the trace number 
(the column names can now be freely chosen).}

\item{plot}{A length-one boolean vector. If \code{TRUE} some 
control/diagnostic plots are displayed.}

\item{r}{A 'RasterLayer' object from the package 'raster' from which
trace elevation \code{z} will be extracted based on the 
trace position \code{(x, y)} on the raster. The extracted 
trace elevation will overwrite the values from the third
column of \code{topo}.}

\item{tol}{Length-one numeric vector: if the horizontal distance between 
two consecutive trace positions is smaller than \code{tol}, 
then the traces in between as well as the second trace
position are removed.
If \code{tol = NULL}, \code{tol} is set equal to
\code{sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)}.}

\item{method}{A length-three character vector defining the interpolation
methods (same methods as in \code{signal::interp1}:
"linear", "nearest", "pchip", "cubic", and "spline"). 
First element for the interpolation of the 
inter-trace distances, 
second element for the interpolation of the horizontal 
trace positions, and third element for the interpolation
of the vertical trace positions.}
