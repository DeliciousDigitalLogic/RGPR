}
\description{
Use constrained least squares. Based on the code of Ivan Selesnick:
 "we minimize
  the energy of the the third derivative. This encourages the filled in data 
 to have the form of a parabola (second order polynomial), because the third
  derivative of a parabola is zero."
+ constraint (i.e., constrained least squares) like in
