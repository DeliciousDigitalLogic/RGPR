\title{Direct-Current shift removal}
\usage{
\S4method{dcshift}{GPR}(x, u = NULL, FUN = mean, ..., track = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{GPR class}] An object of the class \code{GPR}.}

\item{u}{[\code{integer}] Index of the trace samples used to evaluate for
every trace the DC-shift. If \code{u = NULL}, the function takes
for each trace 90\% of the samples before time-zero (the number
of samples can vary from trace to trace).}

\item{FUN}{[\code{function}] A function to apply on the \code{u} trace 
samples (default is \code{mean}; alternatively, \code{median} 
could be of interest because it is more robust but slower to 
compute).}

\item{...}{[\code{ANY}] Further arguments to be passed to \code{FUN}.}
}
\value{
[\code{GPR class}] An object of the class \code{GPR}.
}
\description{
The direct-current offset (DC-shift) is estimated and removed from every 
trace individually. 
For a given trace, the DC-shift is estimated by a user supplied function 
applied on few trace samples, normally the samples before time-zero
(e.g., the average of the samples before time-zero).  Then, the
DC-shift is substracted from the trace.
}
\details{
The direct-current offset (or DC-shift) is a constant bias over time
that slightly shifts the signal amplitude. The DC-shift is best 
observed on the trace samples recorded before the signal was emitted. 

Modified slots
\itemize{
  \item \code{data}: DC-shift removed (data dimensions unchanged).
  \item \code{proc}: updated with function name and arguments.
